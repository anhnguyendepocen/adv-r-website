**Problem with writing functions within functions**

Things will get messy and more difficult to read and debug as we deal with more complex operations on data.

Do you recall composite functions such as $f \circ g(x)$?

Now we have $f \circ g \circ h (x)$ or `round(mean(c(4, 8, 16)))`

.pull-left[

```{r eval = FALSE}

  g() %>%
